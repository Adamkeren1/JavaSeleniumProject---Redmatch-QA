# JavaSeleniumProject---Redmatch-QA

This is a small taste of a java selenium based automation project.

I used java framework to operate selenium library actions + Db connection using JDBC library.

I used a page object model  design pattern for this project.

This project was created in 2015 , and was my first expirience with Selenium Automation project.
